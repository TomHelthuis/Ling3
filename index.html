<b>Quote 1: Language is the dress of thought. ~Samuel Johnson</b>b<BR><BR>
Why did I pick this quote?
I am able to express myself through language. When I want something, I’m able to specifically point out what I want and how I want it. I’m able to express anything I want, thanks to language.<BR><BR><BR>

<b>Quote 2: Thanks to words, we have been able to rise above the brutes; and thanks to words, we have often sunk to the level of the demons. ~Aldous Huxley</b><BR><BR>
Why did I pick this quote?
I love this quote because it feels like the 2 sentences are in contradiction with each other. I often hear that we are different from animals because we are able to communicate with each other on a level no animal could. And because of this, we can hurt each other more than animals or brutes ever could. It’s both funny and sad to think about. <BR><BR><BR>

<b>Quote 3: Learn a new language and get a new soul. ~Czech Proverb</b><BR><BR>
Why did I pick this quote?
When I was 17, I started to learn speaking English pretty good. I managed to get in contact with native speakers through video games, and I started to have basic conversations with them. As I was speaking with them, I noticed something. Though I was acting like myself, I was different at the same time, like a different person all together. When I got into this course, my classmates had the exact same thing. You’re becoming a different person when you learn a new language.
<BR><BR>
<font size="4">1.2 Learning a language</font> <BR>
It’s possible to learn a language; since you can actively try to get closer and closer to a higher level then you were before by learning grammar, vocabulary, etc. Every time you do this you will remember more and more about the language, and know what type of words you have to use in certain situations. It’s definitely possible to do this.<BR><BR>

In my opinion there is a clear difference in acquiring language and learning a language. While there are similarities since you gain knowledge both ways, the difference lies in how you obtain the knowledge. 
When you learn a language, you actively read books, write down sentences, listen to audio fragments with a clear goal in mind: learn this language.
When you acquire a language, something different happens. When you hear a certain word or sentence in multiple series or movies, you naturally start to notice this. Take the phrase ‘Are you taking the piss mate?’ This means: are you mocking me/Screwing around/ kidding me?
But when you have an assignment, asking to translate the sentence: ‘Neem je me nou in de maling?’, you will refer to that one specific sentence you hear all the time in the movies. You have unconsciously AQUIRED it. That’s the difference. The one is conscious, the other unconscious. <BR><BR>
<font size="4">1.3 Creativity</font> <BR>
I believe every person in the world is creative. Some people just choose to express their creativity in another way, other than paintings, videos or poems. Some people are creative in planning, or talking, or playing a sport in his own unique style. I do believe you are able to learn to expand your creativity, but creativity is something you are born with. I also believe you are able to stimulate creativity, but the person itself will decide what to do with it. <BR><BR> 

<BR><BR><BR> <font size="6">Assignment 2</font> <BR><BR><BR>

<font size="4">2.1 Origin of language</font> <BR>
<b>Explain where language comes from, including possible consequences for L2 teaching (what does this mean for your teaching?).</b><BR><BR>
Language comes from before our time, when the caveman started to appear. We figured out how we are able to form certain consonants and sounds by placing our tongue and mouth in different positions. Sounds formed into words, and words formed into sentences. Even today, words and meaning are constantly changing. Eventually we decide what goes into the dictionary and what doesn’t.

<BR><BR>
<font size="4">2.2 Thought Language</font> <BR><BR>

<b>Do you think language? If so, what language? L1 (your mother tongue) or L2 (for instance English)?</b><BR><BR>
In normal circumstances I do think language. When I’m by myself, or when I’m having a normal conversation, I do think before I speak. Before I say anything, I first check and see if it’s appropriate inside my head before saying it. It also depends on the situation if I speak English or  Dutch.
<BR><BR>
<b>What goes faster: thinking or speaking? Why? Discuss.</b><BR><BR>
First of all, it depends on the situation. There are scenarios where you simple don’t have the time to think. When this is the case, you do have some form of answer in your head that feels like what you want to have, but it’s not properly in your head yet. So in my opinion, thinking is faster, since you always unconsciously think before you speak.

<BR><BR>

<font size="4">2.3 Dreams</font> <BR><BR>
<b>Do you dream language?<BR><BR> What/how do you dream?</b><BR><BR>
Dreams itself are vague. There are instances where I can remember them very clearly, and times where I can’t remember them at all. I do feel that in a dream, I did talk to someone or something before. So if I talked, or he/she/it talked back, I guess that counts as dreaming about language. Speaking the language in a dream is dreaming language.<BR><BR>
 <b>(How) Do blind/ deaf people dream?</b><BR><BR>
I believe they dream in a different way because they see the world in a different way. I have read somewhere that someone managed to regain his eyesight after having lost it for a long time. A blind person sees the world completely different. Their vision of a table is completely different then our own vision of a table.
So if they see the world different from us, their dreams must be too. The same applies for deaf people. Their way of communication affects their way of seeing the world, making their dreams different too. 
<BR><BR><BR>
<BR><BR><BR> <font size="6">Assignment 3</font> <BR><BR><BR>
<font size="4">3.1 Dream language</font> <BR>
I think I was not too far off in my opinion. I believe that blind and deaf people have a different perspective of life then we do, and that it affects their dreams. Though Mark Blechner think that dreams are something else entirely, it is connected to linguistics, meaning that blind and deaf people do have different kind of dreams. It’s a different form of community, for both parties. <BR><BR><BR>
<font size="4">3.2 What is language awareness</font> <BR>
Language is for many the one thing that separates us from animals. The way we communicate and respond is the most important part of language awareness. Language awareness can be looked at from multiple angles; the physical and formal way is the most obvious one. But the informal, body language, hand signs en underlying meaning of language is also very important. The meaning of the word is way more important the definition of the word. We use language everyday and everywhere, from school to the supermarket, to being home, being on the internet. We also receive just as much language as we produce ourselves, such as listening to the radio, reading something online, watching TV. There are also a lot of debates going on, related to grammar, and vocabulary, and learning multiple languages to foreigners and immigrants. Social media has an entire way of communicating and using language on its own, and often these ways of communicating completely conflicts with today’s language and use of speech. In order to solve these problems, we have to be way more aware about our language, like the way we speak and the way we perceive certain words or sentences. That’s not going to be easy.
<BR><BR><BR>
<BR><BR><BR> <font size="6">Assignment 4</font> <BR><BR><BR>
<font size="4">4.1 Language in theory</font> <BR><BR>
<b>The Direct Method</b> <BR>
In this method the teaching is done entirely in the target language. The learner is not allowed to use his or her mother tongue. Grammar rules are avoided and there is emphasis on good pronunciation. <BR><BR>
<b>Grammar-translation</b><BR>
Learning is largely by translation to and from the target language. Grammar rules are to be memorized and long lists of vocabulary learned by heart. There is little or no emphasis placed on developing oral ability. <BR><BR>
<b>Audio-lingual</b><BR>
The theory behind this method is that learning a language means acquiring habits. There is much practice of dialogues of every situation. New language is first heard and extensively drilled before being seen in its written form. <BR><BR>
<b>The structural approach</b><BR>
This method sees language as a complex of grammatical rules which are to be learned one at a time in a set order. So for example the verb "to be" is introduced and practised before the present continuous tense which uses "to be" as an auxiliary.<BR><BR>
<b>Suggestopedia</b><BR>
The theory underlying this method is that a language can be acquired only when the learner is receptive and has no mental blocks. By various methods it is suggested to the student that the language is easy - and in this way the mental blocks to learning are removed. 
<BR><BR><BR>

<font size="4">4.2 Personal experience</font> <BR><BR>
Thinking back, acquiring my second language (English) mostly happened in 2 ways. I was taught English at my secondary school, and I learned English my own way. 
English at school was kind of a drag. It wasn’t fun, or interesting. Our school strictly followed the book, and wouldn’t dare trying something original and new. Almost all of my memories consist of me, looking either on the board on finishing assignments. The only thing English in class did for me was helping me refine my English by applying official grammar rules on my self-taught English. My self-taught English however, is where I actually learned it.
When I was a kid I had 2 hobbies: The first one was playing video games. The second one was browsing the internet. I truly acquired English by playing video games. Quoting video game characters because it sounded cool was something I did a lot. When I didn’t know a word, or multiple words in a sentence, I looked it up. These words have always stuck to me because I found some sentences or some words truly interesting. At the age of 15 I got my very first headphones, which allowed talking with people while playing video games. I had full-fledged conversations with people from around the world, mostly Americans. This way I was able to my speech and grammar with actual foreigners. I really grew because of it. As for my writing, that’s where the internet comes in to play. I spent a lot of my free time being on the internet, reading, writing, having conversations or heated debates with others from around the world. 
I guess my conclusion would be to practice with the real thing. You’ll automatically acquire language this way, which is way better then learning. (It is in my opinion.)
<BR><BR><BR>
<BR><BR><BR> <font size="6">Assignment 5</font> <BR><BR><BR>
<font size="4">5.1Teaching language </font> <BR><BR>
 I already had a certain idea about the way I wanted to teach. I believe that learning and acquiring language through a more visual approach would approach better results since it said visual information is being processed by the brain around 60.000 times faster than reading. The structural and suggestopedia approach are very important as well. I do believe that students need to be in an environment where they believe they can actually do it. After this I slowly (using visuals) want to teach student in a structural manner what they need to know, from the ‘to be’ verb to full-fledged conversations. As I have learned from TEFL2, it is unwise to solely focus on vocabulary, but also unwise to solely focus on grammar, I’ll try to build up both vocabulary and  grammar simultaneously, using different themes ( like your own house, going on holiday, etc )  I believe I also would like to include the Audio-Lingual approach. On my TP, having conversations in English is avoided, which I think should is a shame. When you experience the way you should speak English first hand, you’ll get a much better understanding on why certain grammar rules apply.  Not only that, the student will experience firsthand the things they have learned.

				<h3>Language myths</h3><BR>
				
				<p>
				<b>LANGUAGE MYTHS 1 & 2</b><BR> Answer: Language already changes, all the time<BR>
	Language changes overtime. Because a word can lose meaning or impact, or simply because the entire society just pronounces a certain word a certain way, it can easily be changed. A lot of words also have different kinds of origins, like Latin or French. 
‘Languages are self regulating systems that can take care of themselves.’
<BR><BR><BR>
				<b>Myth 3: The media is ruining English </b> <BR>
Myth answer is: It’s just a different way of communicating.<BR>
Languages are self regulating systems which can be left to take care of themselves. They are self regulating because their speakers want to understand each other and be understood.<BR><BR><BR>
<b>Myth 5: English spelling is Kattastroffik</b><BR>
Myth answer is: There is no logical answer, it’s the way English evolved.<BR>
Even though there are only 5 vowels in the English language, it turns out there are 24 vowel sounds. Multiple vowel combinations make different sounds, and some make the exact same sound. The consonants are even more random. There is no logic in the English spelling, other than just accepting English evolved this way.
<BR><BR><BR>
					<b>Myth 8: Children can’t speak or write properly anymore</b><BR>
Answer: Social discrimination<BR>
It appears that there are complaints, concerning the younger generation being unable to write or speak properly, and often crawling back to alternatives to communicate.
This is not true in the slightest. The younger generation is able to speak and write English just as well as the previous generation. The cause of this uproar is mostly about social discrimination. <BR><BR><BR>

<b>Myth 10: Some languages have no grammar.</b><BR>
Answer: verbs and noun form grammar<BR>
To answer the myth (while summarizing this chapter) there needs to be a clear understanding of what grammar is: 
Grammar is a specific set of rules, (mostly) applied on verbs to specify a sentence to a certain degree. This means the way words are being put together, rules about meaning, and so on. As long as languages have noun and verbs, grammar exists. It does not matter whether a grammar book exists for that language or not.
<BR><BR><BR>
<b>Myth 11: Italian is beautiful, German is ugly.</b><BR>
Answer: It’s all subjective<BR>
People often label language the way we hear it, or referencing it from. One of the many reasons people believe German sounds ugly is because they associate German with Hitler. And these are the same people that associate French with the Eiffel tower. And seemingly the Eiffel Tower is a romantic place to be, French is automatically considered to be a romantic language. It’s going to be different for every person, depending where you’re from. <BR><BR><BR>
<b>Myth 13: Black children are verbally deprived.</b><BR>
Answer: untrue and pretty racist too!<BR>
This chapter states that African children are unable to speak the English language well for some reason. Supposedly the reason for the would be the different in lip size. This theory should be quickly debunked as there are enough non African English speakers who can speak English just as well. Besides, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King are able to speak English just as well as the next person, so the idea of African kids not being able to speak English very well is just bullsh*t.<BR><BR><BR>
<b>Myth 14: Double negatives are illogical</b><BR>
Answer: It doesn’t not make no sense to me.<BR>
You see it all the time in slang. ‘I’m not no wimp’ I see it everywhere and I don’t understand why. A double negative makes it positive. If you’re not  not something, you are that something. There are dutch variations of this as well. In my opinion it is highly illogical, and I don’t understand as to why this came to be.

<BR><BR><BR>


<b>Language myth 15: TV makes people sound the same.</b><BR>
Answer: This is true, to a certain extent.<BR>
It’s true that the media has the power to make a certain word more popular for a while. But true change takes place by having conversations with each other. We borrow little nudges of accents and vocabulary with each other this way, and has more effect then television.

<BR><BR><BR>
<b>Language myth 18: Some languages are spoken more quickly than others.</b><BR>
Answer: It depends on a person’s pronunciation.<BR>

Scientists have found out a way to measure the speed of pronouncing a syllable and vowel per second, and hereby trying to declare the most difficult spoken language. This is all an illusion. Not everyone speaks in the same pace, dialect, the way you were raised all have consequences on this. There is no clear indication.

<b>What is the definition of slang?</b><BR><BR>
Slang is a certain type of language, made up of already existing language, which is usually very informal. Slang differs a lot, depending on the context and the group of people.
Slang is often confused with other types of language deviations, such as:<BR><BR><BR>
-	Catchphrases<BR>
-	Informal language ( such as imma ( I am ), or gonna ( going to )<BR>
-	And most often confused one: Dialect. Dialect is a result of bordering countries, while slang is boundless. It can appear anywhere.<BR><BR><BR>

It’s possible for a slang word to become a trend, especially nowadays. Social media allows slang to spread like a wild fire. It often ends within a couple of months / years or sticks long enough to earn a spot in the urban dictionary. Slang words also say a lot about the people who use these words, especially when some words are bound to very specific groups of people. 
 It is said that slang words are often being created by ‘trend pioneers’ who wants to freshen up the language, and to create/ express their own identity a bit more. When this is catchy, the trend goes on, people start using it and the slang word is born. Most of these individuals might be unaware of their own creation. It’s most likely the opposite, and just invents a new word anyway, not thinking any of the consequences exist.<BR>
Some very recent slang examples are the following:<BR><BR><BR>

-	Lit ( it’s cool )<BR>
-	Bruh (dude…)<BR>
-	Fam (family/friends)<BR><BR><BR>


Dutch examples are:<BR><BR><BR>
-	Faka ( how are you )<BR>
-	Niffauw ( mate, friend )<BR>
-	Doekoe ( money )<BR><BR><BR>

<b>History of slang:</b><BR><BR>
The history of slang is kind of blur, and hard to pinpoint. As stated in the third paragraph, slang either disappears from existence, or sticks long enough to become an official word. Any words we use right now might have been slang 500 years ago, and we don’t even realize it. 

Apperantly the first signs of slang words is found in 1530, where a ‘thieves cant ‘ had their very own version of the English language. Though I was not able to find any examples, their version of English differed a lot from the original.
<BR><BR><BR>
Where does slang come from nowadays?<BR><BR>
Slang can be born from pretty much everything. From a ‘meme’ that goes viral, to music. Music ( mostly American hip-hop )  is a big help in creating slang words everyone is using today: juju, whip nae nae, are all examples of this. 
<BR><BR>
Many ‘memes’ are also slang inspiration, like the phrase ‘I can’t even ‘ implying that something is so funny or scary, the meme is not able to finish the sentence, only able to say ‘I can’t even’ . 
<BR><BR>
I can go on with these examples, but I think the point comes across. Social media has a huge influence on the modern slang world, and it’s still moving.
<BR><BR><BR>
<b>Implications of slang in modern society:</b><BR><BR><BR>

Over the years, slang has been developing more and more over the years. But what effects does this have on society? 
I’m here to inform that slang has both positive and negative effects on society.
A positive effect is that slang is usually the start of change. Slang words are often being adapted into today’s speech. And when everybody is saying it, that’s when it starts to become an official word, grammar phrases or word shorteners. OMG has become an everyday phrase. And text message mostly consist of words like lol, idk, wyd, etc.
<BR><BR>
Change is constant, why not embrace it. 
Negative effects of slang would be that a new generation would have no clue what we are talking about. From complete made up words like ‘faka’ and ‘niffauw’ , to phrases like ‘lit’ to word shorteners like idk, wyd, etc. It’s important that formal language must be preserved, and not be cast aside using these new words.
<BR><BR>

Social Media is a big help in this. New phrases are spreading like wildfire thanks to social media such as facebook and instagram. 
<BR><BR><BR>
How does it affect the classroom? <BR><BR><BR>
It’s possible that your students already might have developed slang words that you don’t even know. How do you deal with that? Studies have shown around 30 percent of the teachers in Holland don’t know what the students are talking about half the time. How do you deal with this? Food for thought.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
